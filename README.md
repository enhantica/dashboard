# Dashboard

The **Dashboard** repository hosts the generated HTML dashboards for Enhantica projects.  
These dashboards, built with [Badgery](https://github.com/enhantica/badgery), provide 
at-a-glance views of code metrics, CI results, and release information.

Dashboards are published automatically to GitHub Pages and can be accessed at:<br>
https://enhantica.github.io/dashboard/{repo-name}/{branch}

Example for Badgery (fix-doc-rules branch): <br>
